# Custom extensions example
#
# The purpose of custom extensions is to allow functionality to be implemented
# without modifying the base deployment code.  Additionally control over these
# extensions can be exposed via the extensions__fieldX fields to allow functionality
# to be added WITHOUT changes to the presentation layer. By exposing the extension
# fields as tenant editable we can add code to this portion of the iApp to handle
# new functionality without changing the northbound data model
#
# The following procs are called at various points during the implementation:
#   custom_extensions_start: Called at the start of the deployment after mode is determined
#   custom_extensions_before_pools:  Called before processing all pool(s) starts
#   custom_extensions_before_pool:  Called before processing to create the pool starts
#   custom_extensions_after_pool: Called immediately after the pool is created
#   custom_extensions_after_pools: Called immediately after all pool(s) are created
#   custom_extensions_before_vs:  Called before processing to create the virtual server starts
#   custom_extensions_after_vs: Called immediately after the virtual server is created
#   custom_extentions_end: Called at the end of the deployment
#
# Guidelines:
#  - Avoid name collisions please prefix variables with 'custom_' unless used by the base deployment code
#  - Restrict modifications to global presentation layer variables unless absolutely required
#  - Try to modify the config once created by the base deployment code to maintain compatibility
#
# Two examples are implemented here:
#  - custom_example_1: Called from all hooks to dump some info to the debug log
#  - custom_example_2: (Disabled by default) Called at the end of the deployment to execute
#                      a tmsh::create command
