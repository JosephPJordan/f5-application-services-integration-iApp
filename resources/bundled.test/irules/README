To include iRules in your template save the file in this directory with a ".irule" extension.  
When the template is built the .irule files in this directory will be dynamically included 
in the template.  

The name of the irule in the template will match the filename without the ".irule" extension

Any bundled iRules that are selected for deployment will be appended AFTER any iRules included 
in the $vs__iRules variable

The following variables will be dynamically substituted on deployment with the relevant values:

 Variable      |   Description
------------------------------------------------------------------
%APP_PATH%     | The full path to the iApp (Ex: /Common/myiApp.app)
%APP_NAME%     | The iApp name 
%VS_NAME%      | The name of the deployed virtual server
%POOL_NAME%    | The name of the deployed pool
%PARTITION%    | The partition we deployed under
